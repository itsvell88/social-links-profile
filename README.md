## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

(1) I learned how to create interactive buttons using html button mark up.
(2) How to apply javascript to buttons so they direct users to the designated web pages, and open in new tabs.
(3) Utilise 'gap' instead of relying on margins to create spacing for each elements.

### Continued development

Focusing on getting familiar with javascript syntax, better understand variables, and explore other functions. I want to be able to build a more interactive page.

### Useful resources

- [HTML, CSS, & Javascript Cheatsheet](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Help me find suitable functions and code to use in developing the web page.
